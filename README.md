## gulp-rsync

Use the file transferring and syncing capabilities of rsync within your Gulp task.

### Prerequisites

rsync needs to be installed on your machine.

### Installation

```
npm install gulp-rsync --save-dev
```

### Usage

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var rsync = require('gulp-rsync');

gulp.task('deploy', function() {
  gulp.src('build/**')
    .pipe(rsync({
      root: 'build',
      hostname: 'example.com',
      destination: '/path/to/site'
    });
});
```

### API

#### `rsync(options)`

##### `options`

###### `destination`

Type: `string`, **Required**

The destination path. Use `hostname` when using a remote path.

###### `root`

Type: `string`, Default: `process.cwd()`

Specifying a root path changes the path names that are transferred to the
destination. The paths piped into rsync must be within the root path (or the
plugin will yell at you).

```js
gulp.src('build/js/**']).pipe(rsync({destination: '/tmp'});
```

This will create the directory `build` in `/tmp` as well as the directory `js`
in `/tmp/build`.

```js
gulp.src('build/js/**']).pipe(rsync({root: 'build', destination: '/tmp'});
```

This will create the directory `js` in `/tmp`.

###### `hostname`

Type: `string`

The hostname of the destination. rsync will connect to this hostname using SSH
along with configuration in `~/.ssh/config` or SSH keys stored in a keychain.

When this is omitted, rsync will transfer the content to a local path.

###### `username`

Type: `string`

Used to specify a user for the remote host.

###### `shell`

Type: `string`

Used to specify the remote shell to use.

###### `port`

Type: `integer`

Used to specify the port for the remote host
(overrides the `shell` option to `ssh -p {port}`).

###### `incremental`

Type: `boolean`, Default: `false`

If set to `true`, rsync will make incremental updates only. rsync will use the
checksum of every file to determine whether a file needs to be updated. This
will add a delay to the transfer, but will minimize the amount of files
transferred each time.

###### `progress`

Type: `boolean`, Default: `false`

If set to `true`, the transfer progress for each file will be displayed in the
console.

This looks like:

```
[20:49:53] gulp-rsync: Starting rsync to example.com:/var/www/example.com/html/...

[20:49:53] gulp-rsync: total size is 114173  speedup is 57.01 
[20:49:53] gulp-rsync: Completed rsync.
```

###### `relative`

Type: `boolean`, Default: `true`

By default, gulp-rsync will transfer all paths relative to the `root` specified.
If you want to transfer assets from multiple paths to a single destination, you
can set `relative` to `false`.

```js
gulp.src(['build/js/**/*.js', 'build/css/**/*.css', 'build/images/**'])
  .pipe(rsync({
    hostname: 'example.cdn',
    destination: '/path/to/all/assets',
    relative: false
  });
```

This will transfer all assets (*.js, *.css, and images) into a single directory.

###### `emptyDirectories`

Type: `boolean`, Default: `false`

If set to `true`, rsync will create empty directories.

###### `recursive`

Type: `boolean`, Default: `false`

If set to `true`, rsync will transfer all files and subdirectories recursively.
This is not necessary when using glob(s) with `gulp.src()`. However, it can be
combined with non-globbed paths to transfer all files:

```
gulp.src(['build/js', 'build/css', 'build/images'])
  .pipe(rsync({
    root: 'build',
    destination: '/tmp',
    recursive: true
  });
```

This is the same as:

```
gulp.src(['build/js/**', 'build/css/**', 'build/images/**'])
  .pipe(rsync({
    root: 'build',
    destination: '/tmp'
  });
```

The difference is that the actual `rsync` command used in the first example is
much shorter.

###### clean

Type: `boolean`, Default: `false`

This must be used with `recursive` set to `true`. If set to `true`, this
instructs rsync to delete all files and directories that are not in the source
paths. **Be careful with this option as it could lead to data loss.**

###### `exclude`

Type: `string|Array<string>`

Enables files or directories matching the pattern(s) provided to be excluded
from the transfer. This is probably most useful when `recursive` is set to
`true` since it is typically better to make these exclusions in `gulp.src()`.

###### `include`

Type: `string|Array<string>`

Used with `exclude`. This adds exceptions for the exclusions.

For example:

```
gulp.src('build')
  .pipe(rsync({
    root: 'build',
    destination: '/tmp',
    recursive: true,
    exclude: ['*.css', '*.js'],
    include: ['*.min.css', '*.min.js']
  });
```

This will transfer only minified CSS and JS files.

###### `silent`

Type: `boolean`, Default: `false`

Turns off logging.
